Hello everyone,

My name is Patrick Padilla. I am a senior year student at Florida International University persuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I would like to work in the aerospace industry. I want to learn more coding so I can get more involved in the engineering clubs at FIU.
